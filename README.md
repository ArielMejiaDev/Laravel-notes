# Laravel notes
This repo contains notes, warnings, tricks and tips from my development experience with Laravel.

## Change Timezone
config folder - app.php file
in config array on "timezone" key change the value from UTC to date time you want, search in [PHP DOCS](https://www.php.net/manual/es/timezones.php)

## Work with SqlServer:
- "SA" is the root user, password is from installation or you could create a user with SQL Server Manager 
- Enable TCP protocol from SQL Server Config
- If use Linux could install from [Microsoft guide] ()
- if use Windows you will need ODBC installer and SQL Server Manager
- dates not work as well as in Mysql or Sql lite so you need to change dates from migrations in Models files, you have two options:

Cast the property $dateFormat that join created_at and updated_at fields with the next code: 
  
```php
    protected $dateFormat = 'Ymd H:i:s';
```
  
 Or overwrite the original method that writes the date in Eloquent with a trait, something like this:
 
```php
  namespace App;
  trait SqlServerGetDateFormat
  {
      public function getDateFormat()
      {
          return 'Y-m-d H:i:s';
      }

  }
```

 This allow to add the trait to all models from app folder with and elegant way and no need to cast all models dateFormat fileds, like.
 
 ```php
  namespace App;
  use Illuminate\Notifications\Notifiable;
  use Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\MustVerifyEmail;
  use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;
  class User extends Authenticatable
  {
      use Notifiable, SqlServerGetDateFormat;
      ...
  }
 ```
 
 Other way to fix this is to cut the length of the default date format of Laravel migrations to:
 
  ```php
    $table->timestamps(4);
  ```
  ## Migraciones
  
 From Laravel 5.6 the auth could have a user migration with type "bigIncrement" instead of "increment".
 both could be use but if a migration have bigIncrement in some field to be referenced as foreign key you will need
 to be explicit with it as "unsignedInteger" if its "increment" or "unsignedBigInteger" if its "bigIncrement".
 you could read more about it [here a Larvel Daily post](https://laraveldaily.com/be-careful-laravel-5-8-added-bigincrements-as-defaults/)
 
 File Of strong type model.
 
 ```php
  Schema::create('transactions_types', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->bigIncrements('id');
    $table->string('name');
    $table->timestamps();
  });
  ```
  File of week type
  
 ```php
  Schema::create('transactions', function (Blueprint $table) {
      $table->bigIncrements('id');
      $table->bigInteger('transaction_type_id')->unsigned();//--------------------------Here is the change from integer to bigInteger.
      $table->foreign('transaction_type_id')->references('id')->on('transactions_types');
      $table->decimal('amount');
      $table->timestamps();
  });
 ```
  - You can change the type of some migration property in model by cast a property 
  in model file but instead of this you can add directly in your migrations the type boolean and no need to cast an integer to bool
  
```php
  Schema::create('products', function (Blueprint $table) {
      $table->bigIncrements('id');
      $table->string('name');
      $table->boolen('status');//instead of integer
      $table->timestamps();
  });
 ```
  - You can set default values for some fields directly in migration and saves you 
  add it to all factories or even as a default value when the app is on production.
  
```php
  Schema::create('products', function (Blueprint $table) {
      $table->bigIncrements('id');
      $table->string('name');
      $table->boolen('status')->default(0);//instead of integer
      $table->timestamps();
  });
 ```
  
  ## Model changes
  
  - you could cast values of certain fields
  - you could use the convention of model as singular and table as plural but you could change this as: 
  
 ```php
  protected $table = '*TableNamePlaceholder*';
 ```
  - you could maintain the convention of table id as 'id', but if you change it the model binding and the find() method
  will fail so to use it as usually you need to change the primary key value explicit as:
  
 ```php
  protected $primaryKey = '*idPlaceholder*';
 ```
  - either you could change the default name of timestamps values 'created_at' and 'updated_at' like this:
  
 ```php
  const CREATED_AT = '*createdAtTitleChangedPlaceholder*';
  const UPDATED_AT = '*updatedAtTitleChangedPlaceholder*';
 ```
  - Remember to fill data in table you need to be explicit to avoid the massive assignment prevention of Laravel as:
  
 ```php
  protected $fillable = [ 'row1', 'row2' .... ];
 ```
 
  - a pretty interesting setting in model is the ability to set some property as softdelete to protect it and the delete method work only as a softdelete, you could use softDelete() method but in some cases you will set this in the model to prevent to delete a specific field and to work as some interface to other developers or the same in the future to protect from him or herself.
  
 ```php
  use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\SoftDeletes;
  class post extends Model 
  {
    use SoftDeletes;//this set a softDelete only to this field on DB or property of model. (here delete() works same as softDelete() ).
    protected $date = 'nameOfTheDateRowOrWhateverRowTypeOrNameIsJustAnExample';
  }
 ```
 
  - To make get data of an object binded by foreign key you can create custom functions in models to get data related 
    with the id of the foreign key a classic example is the relation that have a post from a blog with an author, 
    in this example a post just can have one author so the relation is one to many, 
    one author to many posts that can be written by the same author, so a post belongs to one author:
    
  ```php
  public function author()
  {
    //if user model follows the convention of id with name 'id'
    return $this->belongsTo(App\user);
    //else you can add a second param with the custom id field name
    return $this->belongsTo(App\user, 'id_author');
  }
 ```
 
 ## Auth validation
 
  - To make a manual compare from Password enter by a user and password from DB you could use the method Hash::check()
  it requeries two params, first the password write and send by user and the password of a model 
  but this cant be fetch directly as "model->password" so you could use "model->getAuthPassword()" to get the model certainly you
  will need something as id or email or user to find the model to compare with find() method 
  so a very complete example will be something like this.
  
 ```php
  public function index(Request $request)
  {
    $user = $this->repo->getUserCredentials($request->email);//Repo get user from DB by email
    //send the model from repo and the request with data provided by user.
    $this->validates(['user' => $user, 'request' => $request]);
  {
  
  public function validates($data)//data is the array
  {
       if ($data['user']) {//if user exists because findOrfail redirect and find returns null or false
            if (Hash::check($data['request']->password, $data['user']->getAuthPassword())) {
                return 'OK You are logged in';
            }
        }
        return 'Auth Error!';
  {
```
 
 ## Faker tricks
 
  - you could need to fill data in a factory with some data related from user instead of use an array with users ids, and a random value from those with native function rand(minId, MaxId), you could do this:
  
```php
  $factory()->define(App\SomeModel::class, function(Faker $faker) {
    return [
      'author' => App\User::all()->random(),
      ...
    ];
  });
```

 - If want to simulate a password
 
 ```php
  $faker->bcrypt('passwordStringToTest');
```

 - If want to simulate a names or phrases with some number of words, faker support with some methods like name, paragraph, text, address ect two arguments the number of words to display and false as second param:
 
 ```php
  $faker->paragraph(3, false);
```

## Request

 - If you want to get all data submitted from any request you could get it as an object with:
```php
  $Request();
```
 - If you want to get data from a request but not a form request, (REST API) for example
 ```php
  $Request()->user;//or whatever property that be part of the request object
```
 - you could get inputs data from a request as :
 
```php
  $Request()->input('inputNameFromNameAttributeInHTML');
```

## Validations

 - unique() to not repeat some data in DB.
 - unique() have an exception you could pass as argument the id of current model to access update method and update some data but if the unique field is the same it will accept an exception from the same model id.
 
 - you can use validate() method from request to validate data in a very elegant way:
 
```php
  $Request()->validate([ 'name' => 'required' ]);
  //if we set more than one rule the values of the array key that represent the name of 
  //the request property must be an array or string with separated by comas
  $Request()->validate([ 'email' => 'required, email, min:5' ]);
  //or params as array more elegant
  $Request()->validate([ 'email' => ['required', 'email', 'min:5'] ]);
  //some example with unique in this case (unique:"tableNamePlaceholder*") refers to db column name to search that be unique
  //and concat exception id if the record updated is the same
  $Request()->validate([ 'email' => ['required', 'email', 'min:5', 'unique:users'.$user->id] ]);
  //From Laravel 5.8 we could do this to pass the column name from db as string and chain a ignore method with user id
   Rule::unique('users')->ignore($user->id),
  //this method Rule support model binding so instead of the int key you could pass entire model
  Rule::unique('users')->ignore($user)
  //if you not follow the id convention of call any id as 'id' in migrations you will need to add the id column name as the second param
  Rule::unique('users')->ignore($user->id, 'user_id')
  // you could set more than one field unique as this
  Rule::unique('users', 'email_address')->ignore($user->id),
```

## Artisan commands

 - To make a migration and seed joined you could write a migration with a flag:
 
```php
  php artisan migrate:fresh/refresh --seed// to make a migration and fill data at once
```

 - If you are working with a CRUD you could use some flags to avoid creating all related files from a certain model one by one.
 you could create a model with this flags:
 
```php
  php artisan make model ModelNameInSingularToMaintainConvention -a  
```

 It makes a model with a model with convention to be related with current controller, 
 a controller with boilerplate of a source controller and related with a model, a migration and a factory related.
 all at once and with all boilerplate correctly related and reference it.
 
 ## Routes
 
  - To generate all default routes from a CRUD you could use resource type:
   
```php
  Route::resource('post', 'PostController');
  //to generate post urls in PostController file with the convention routes pointing to convention controller methods  
```
